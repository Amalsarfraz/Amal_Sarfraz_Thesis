`Chapter 5: Application of OSTI to Irrigation Crop Withdrawals from IAMs`


(1) `BOI_2D_scenarios_Analysis_June_29_2024.ipynb` has the codes for implemneting OSTI on 19 Basins-Of-Interest (BOI). The results are saved in folder `92_csv_only`. 


(2) `All_OS_unique_scenarios_analysis_01_07_2024.ipynb` has the code to process the results from (1) and generate `Figure 5.3 as 19_BOI_Outlying_Scenarios.png`


(3) `92_OS_analysis_10_07_2024.ipynb` has the screening criteria described in `section 5.3.2 Step C: Screening`. The results are stored in `pattern_folders`. 


(4) `Heatmaps_OS1_OS5` has all the codes to generate `Figure 5.6 - 5.10 Heatmaps for OS 1 - OS 5`. 



(5) `Time_Dynamics_OS 1.ipynb` generates `Figure 5.11 as Time dynamics across 18 years(2015-2100) for 19 BOI `.


(6) `DD_OS1_Crop trajectories_IRB.ipynb` generates `Figure 5.12 as Cropping statistics of OS 1 and 3000 scenarios maximum, minimum and average from 2015 to 2100`
