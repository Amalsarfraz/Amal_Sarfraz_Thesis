The folder `6.2.4.1 Experimental_design` has three subfolders for each case. 


`Case 1` 

(*) `Case1_km3_04_08_2024.ipynb` has the codes for running the analysis. 


(*) The files `meltwater_hist_km3.txt (melt water comopnent)`, `rainbase_km3.txt (rainbase component)` and `total_km3.txt (total streamflow)` have streamfllow components in km3.


(*) The folder `Case1_final_km3` has all the results files `1.rescaled_meltwater` has the parameterised meltwater, `2.combined` has the parameterised plus the rainbase component, `6. results` has all the results and `7. individual_scenario_plots` has the individual scenario plots for supply and demands. 


`Case 2` 

(*) `Case2_km3_04_08_2024.ipynb` has the codes for running the analysis. 


(*) The files `meltwater_hist_km3.txt (melt water comopnent)`, `rainbase_km3.txt (rainbase component)` and `total_km3.txt (total streamflow)` have streamfllow components in km3.


(*) The folder `Case2_km3` has all the results files `1.rescaled_meltwater` has the parameterised meltwater, `2.combined` has the parameterised plus the rainbase component, `6. results` has all the results and `7. individual_scenario_plots` has the individual scenario plots for supply and demands. 


`Case 3` 

(*) `Case3_04_08_2024.ipynb` has the codes for running the analysis. 


(*) The files `meltwater_hist_km3.txt (melt water comopnent)`, `rainbase_km3.txt (rainbase component)` and `total_km3.txt (total streamflow)` have streamfllow components in km3.


(*) The folder `Case3_km3` has all the results files `1.rescaled_meltwater` has the parameterised meltwater, `2.combined` has the parameterised plus the rainbase component and `6. results` has all the results (including parallel plots and additional analysis for crops).
